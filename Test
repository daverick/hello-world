This is to test adding stuff and then pulling the changes into Atom
I created this file in GitHub and then pulled it into Atom.
Now I have added text and I will commit it, see what happens.

It worked, it is amazing ;-). Thanks to my coach Lori I am getting introduced to Git and GitHub and I like it.
Keep pushin' and pullin'!

So now I want to try out merge: see if the changes in this branch will get merged into the master.
