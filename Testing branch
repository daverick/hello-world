This is a test of how to use branches, what I can do with them and how they show up in Atom.
I believe I am slowly turning this into a blog ;-)

So now I have forked a branch (is that what you call it?) in my repo
I have pulled it from GitHub into my Atom project.

What I do not understand is: how can I work on the branch and push the changes just to the branch, not the master?
